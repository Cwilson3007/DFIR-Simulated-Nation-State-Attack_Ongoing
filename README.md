# 🛠️ Investigating a Nation-State Supply Chain Attack with Multi-Layered Evasion Techniques

## 🌍 Scenario
 A multinational corporation has been compromised by a **nation-state actor** 🕵️.
$ The breach has persisted **undetected for over a year**, affecting **thousands of endpoints**.
$ Advanced **evasion techniques** were used to cover tracks. Your mission: **Investigate & Contain**.

# 🚨 Adversary Tactics:
 🏴‍☠️ Living-off-the-Land (LotL)  → Abusing system tools (PowerShell, WMI) for stealth.
$ 🔒 Encrypted C2 Channels       → DNS tunneling, domain fronting, covert HTTP/S beaconing.
$ 📆 Timestomping & Log Wiping   → Modifying timestamps & deleting forensic traces.
$ 💣 Ransomware Distraction      → Encrypting systems to divert incident response teams.

## 🔍 Objective
 🎯 **Your task**: Lead the forensic investigation and uncover the full attack chain.
    ├── 🔹 Identify the **initial entry point** (Was it a trojanized update? A supply chain backdoor?)
    ├── 🔹 Map the **scope of compromise** (Which systems? Lateral movement paths?)
    ├── 🔹 Attribute the **threat actor** (APT, financially motivated group, or insider?)
    ├── 🔹 Provide **actionable defense strategies** (How do we prevent this next time?)

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
 🖥️ Memory Forensics  → Volatility 🧠 for RAM analysis.
$ 🔬 Malware Analysis   → REMnux 🔎 for reverse engineering suspicious binaries.
$ 🌐 Network Forensics  → Wireshark 📡 & Zeek to analyze C2 traffic.
$ 📜 Log Analysis       → Hunting for **deleted logs & modified timestamps**.

## 📝 Notes:
 This project **simulates a real-world forensic case study** 🎭.
$ Findings will be **documented, analyzed, and structured** into a comprehensive report 📑.
$ All results will be **organized for a polished GitHub portfolio showcase** 🚀.
